Quotes about smiling boost your mood and offer fascinating insight.

Even though there are drastic differences between human cultures and the way we express ourselves, psychologist Paul Ekman discovered that facial expressions have a degree of universality that transcends time and place.

Each of these thousands of ways of moving the muscles in our faces, serve to express and reinforce one of the six basic emotions: anger, disgust, enjoyment, fear, sadness, and surprise.

And the most powerful and profound facial expression of them all? The smile.

Smiling is universally considered to be a way we display joy. It can communicate our internal world to people on the outside, and it can be a welcoming sign to new people.

When we smile, our muscles can send feedback to our faces and help to boost our mood.

So we’ve gathered some great quotes about smiling to boost your mood and bring a few more smiles to your day.




“A simple smile. That’s the start of opening your heart and being compassionate to others.”
